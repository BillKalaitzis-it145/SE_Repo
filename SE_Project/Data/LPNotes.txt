This article is about the linear programming algorithm. For the non-linear optimization heuristic, see Nelderâ€“Mead method.
In mathematical optimization, Dantzig's simplex algorithm (or simplex method) is a popular algorithm for linear programming.[1][2][3][4][5] The journal Computing in Science and Engineering listed it as one of the top 10 algorithms of the twentieth century.[6]

The name of the algorithm is derived from the concept of a simplex and was suggested by T. S. Motzkin.[7] Simplices are not actually used in the method, but one interpretation of it is that it operates on simplicial cones, and these become proper simplices with an additional constraint.[8][9][10][11] The simplicial cones in question are the corners (i.e., the neighborhoods of the vertices) of a geometric object called a polytope. The shape of this polytope is defined by the constraints applied to the objective function.
